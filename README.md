# Auto-complete component in React TypeScript.

Demo: https://olegsuv-react-auto-complete.netlify.app/

# Frontend test

document version: 1.3

## Part 1 (up to 90 minutes)
Please prepare an auto-complete component in React TypeScript.
1. You cannot use any 3rd party libraries - only pure React and internal DOM
functions.
2. You should use typescript and write proper interfaces and types.
3. The function to filter the data should be asynchronous. You can use mock data
(such as a JSON array), but the function which uses it should be asynchronous
(similar to a real REST call).

4. It should have basic working CSS. No need for anything fancy (such as drop-
shadows etc), but should look decent.

5. You need to handle all non-standard/edge use-cases - it should have a perfect
user-experience.
6. Highlight the matching part of the text, in addition to showing it.
7. No external state management libraries (refer to #1 as well), only native React
method.
8. Use only functional component with hooks.
9. Shortcuts and hacks are perfectly ok - but you have to add comments on what
are you doing there and why. You should either write production ready code or
include comments on what needs to be changed for production.
10. Add a README.md file explaining how to run the project.
11. Bonus #1: load data using a real API call to some resource.
Results need to be in the form of a GitHub repo link.

## Part 2 (up to 45 minutes)

Frontend test 2
Please answer the following questions to the best of your knowledge, in clear
English. Elaborate and try to demonstrate the React knowledge you have. Feel free
to give examples and use cases.
DO NOT USE ANY WEB OR OTHER RESOURCE.
1. What is the difference between Component and PureComponent? give an
example where it might break my app.
2. Context + ShouldComponentUpdate might be dangerous. Can think of why is
that?
3. Describe 3 ways to pass information from a component to its PARENT.
4. Give 2 ways to prevent components from re-rendering.
5. What is a fragment and why do we need it? Give an example where it might
break my app.
6. Give 3 examples of the HOC pattern.
7. what's the difference in handling exceptions in promises, callbacks and
async...await.
8. How many arguments does setState take and why is it async.
9. List the steps needed to migrate a Class to Function Component.
10. List a few ways styles can be used with components.
11. How to render an HTML string coming from the server.
Results need to be submitted in a questions.md file, in the same
GitHub repo as part 1.

Good luck!
